### JHPCE Cluster Grant Submission Blurb

The Joint High Performance Computing Exchange (JHPCE) is a Johns Hopkins University service center based out of the Biostatistics department of the Johns Hopkins 
Bloomberg School of Public Health. The JHPCE has been providing cost-effective HPC services since 2008 in support of over 100 research groups in the 
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the Johns Hopkins Cary Business School, and several JHU Affiliated organizations.
The JHPCE provides a rich ecosystem of Linux-based statistical and genomics applications, and is specialized to support development in R, python, SAS, and Stata languages.

As of May 2024, the JHPCE cluster is comprised of 66 compute nodes, providing over 5000 64-bit cores/threads and 30 TB of DDR-SDRAM. The JHPCE cluster also has 6 GPU nodes 
with 23 Nvidia V100 and A100 GPUs in support of numerous AI, ML, and LLM efforts across the JHU campuses. The storage environment on the cluster contains 
a total of 20PB of storage with a 2PB Lustre storage cluster, 12PB of ZFS NAS storage, and a 2PB ZFS NAS storage array for offsite disk-to-disk backup, 
all built on the “dirt cheap” storage philosophy.  In addition, a 25 TB NVME SSD based “fast scratch” storage array to support short-term storage of 
high-IO processing. 

### JHPCE CSUB Grant Submission Blurb

The Joint High Performance Computing Exchange (JHPCE) CMS Sub-cluster (CSUB) is a High Performance Compute Cluster which has been built to 
provide secure HPC services for accessing Medicare and Medicaid data in support of researchers in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 
and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The CSUB is a service of the JHPCE, a High-Performance Computing facility in the 
Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that has been in existence since 2008. 
The CSUB is maintained at a high-security level in accordance with federal regulations governing secure computer 
systems (e.g., the Federal Information Security Management Act-FISMA) and meets strict security and privacy requirements of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
The JHPCE provides a rich ecosystem of Linux-based statistical and genomics applications, and is specialized to support development in R, python, SAS, and Stata languages.

As of May 2024, the JHPCE CSUB cluster is comprised of a 4-node compute cluster, providing over 500 64-bit cores  and 5 TB of DDR-SDRAM. The storage environment
for the CSUB is provided by a 100 TB allocation of ZFS encrypted "dirt cheap" storage, and a 50 TB allocation of SSD-based storage.
