# Joint HPC Exchange Constitutional Principles

####The HPC service center is a steward of a commons.
It merely manage resources that are literally owned the stakeholders.

####Policies must be consistent with Ostrom’s design principles
This ensures sustainable utilization of common pool resources.

####Organizations have autonomy in structuring payment model.
Each organization can configure their computing budgets and resources, in a
manner that is consistent with their research agendas and funding
profiles, while being protected from exploitation by larger stakeholder
organizations. Organizations, e.g. divisions, departments, institutes,
collaborations and individual PIs, can provide their local community
with: 1) free computing, 2) subsidized computing, 3) startup packages,
or 4) “bridge funding” for PIs who are “between grants”.

####Free computing is not provided by the service center.
Users must ask
their funding agencies, collaborators, departments or deans to support
their computing.

####Policies for Stakeholders
 All computing queues have associated rates and charges – there is no
free computing for anyone, even stakeholders.
 Organizations can become stakeholders by purchase nodes.
 Stakeholders have priority access to their nodes via their dedicated
queues.
 Stakeholder’s are required to make excess compute cycles available to
all users via the shared queue.
 Under reasonable circumstances (e.g. grant or publication deadlines),
stakeholders are allowed to temporarily block the shared queue from
sending jobs to their hardware.
 Stakeholders are free (within broad limits) to decide on policies for their
community within their queues.
 Lack of capacity on a dedicated queue is typically a signal to
stakeholders that it’s time to invest.

####Policies for Non-Stakeholders
 Users who have no stakeholder affiliation are allowed to compute only
on the shared queue.
 Users who have no stakeholder affiliation have no “right to compute”,
but historically, this has never been an issue, as there has always been
sufficient excess capacity available.
 Lack of capacity on the shared queue is a signal to non-stakeholders
that it’s time to become a stakeholder – or compute elsewhere.
 Practically speaking, there is usually plenty of capacity on the shared
queue.

####The Shared Partition
 Shared queue charges defray the operating charges of the stakeholders.
This incentivizes sharing, e.g. if a stakeholder is not using their
hardware, the shared queue charges (incurred by other users) will cover
the operating expenses of the stakeholder’s node.
 Stakeholders use the shared queue for surge capacity when their own
hardware does not suffice.
 Lack of capacity on the shared queue is typically a signal to
stakeholders and non-stakeholders alike that it’s time to invest in nodes.
 Historically, the cost for using the shared partition is about $0.01 per
hour for a job using a single core and 5GB of RAM.

####Salient storage policies
 There is no free storage
 Each user account comes with 100GB of home directory space
(current rate is $0.45/GB/year, so $45/yr MAX.
 Allocated (guaranteed) storage rate is between $18-$25 TB/year
 limited ‘leased’ storage is available. Recent rate is ~$44/TB/year
(based on TB actually used)
 Home directories are backed up by default, all other storage is
backed up upon request.
