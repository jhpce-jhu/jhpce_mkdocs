# X11/The X Window System

## What is it?
The [X Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) (aka X11, aka X) is the primary GUI system for UNIX computers. X allows a program (an X "client") running on a UNIX computer in the cluster to be displayed on a remote computer (running an X "server"[^1]) over the network. To use it, your local computer needs to have X server software installed on it.

SSH provides support for tunnelling X11 over an encrypted connection. You may need to tell SSH that you want that service, by, for example, adding the -X flag to an ssh command in a macOS Terminal.

X11 has been (slowly) being replaced by [Wayland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)). Wayland has been the future for many years, but is becoming common. However this is usually invisible to users. Mentioned here in case you see references to Wayland where you expect to see X11.

[^1]:Note that X reverses the normal conception of client/server operation, which is that the remote computer is the "server". In X11, the "server" is the program receiving the keyboard and mouse inputs and displaying the output of remote "client" programs.

## How do you get it?

- macOS users need to install [XQuartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuartz) from [xquartz.org](https://www.xquartz.org).
- Windows users need to use a program like MobaXterm. We have a page describing installing and using [MobaXterm](mobaxterm.md).
- Linux laptop or desktop users are already using X as their windowing system.

## Example X11 Programs

xterm, SAS, RStudio, xclock, thunar.

## Configuring SSH To Support X11
!!! Authoring guidance
    The SSH document points to this one for ALL of the information needed to use X11. So this section needs to be complete. Pointing to the [MobaXterm](mobaxterm.md) document of course, for Windows users.


## Troubleshooting X Connections

!!! Authoring guidance
    This section should include pointers to FAQ items or vice versa. We shouldn't rewrite the same information twice!!!
    
- When -X ?
- When -Y ?

- printenv DISPLAY or echo $DISPLAY

- [user@login31 ~]$ srun --pty --x11 bash
srun: error: No DISPLAY variable set, cannot setup x11 forwarding.

- How do Windows users configure ForwardX11Timeout ?

Is `ForwardX11Timeout 0` better in 2024 than specifying a particular time in hours?
