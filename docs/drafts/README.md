mkdocs.yml is configured to ignore this directory and its contents.

(It doesn't build them into the site)

Is that true in terms of GitHub Actions?

Anyway, JRT created it thinking that it would provide a mechanism for us to have a place to stash documents that were in-progress. Collaborators can see and edit them.

JRT SUGGESTS THE CONVENTION:
place documents inside of docs/drafts/ in the same location as they would be found in the docs/ directory tree if they were published.
