# SLURM
JHPCE has used the SGE (Sun Grid Engine) for many years. We are
changing to SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management).  The
SGE codebase is not actively maintained, and the newest version is
about 10 years old at this point. SLURM on the other hand is more
widely used, with regular patches and updates made available.

SLURM and SGE are conceptually similar, with the notion of “jobs”,
“nodes”, “partitions” (known as “queues” in SGE), and resource
allocation for RAM and cores. However the commands and options between
the two schedulers are different.  An orientation to using SLURM on
the JHPCE cluster is available, and we will be providing training
sessions for end users as we get closer to the cutover date. There are
also documents and example code files in /jhpce/shared/jhpce/slurm on
the test nodes.
