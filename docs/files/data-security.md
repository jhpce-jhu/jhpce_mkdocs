#Data Security

This is a stub page for the "Managing Files" topic.


!!! Note "Authoring Note"
    What should users keep in mind about providing the appropriate amount of protection to their data files? (Also, should we have a document that points to outside guides to data management lifecycles? [Case Western Reserve](https://case.edu/researchdata/research-data-lifecycle-guide/project-close-out/nih-policy-data-management-and-sharing) has good documentation.)

Information about satisfying HIPAA standards can be found [here](../joinus/hipaa.md).
