# Sharing Files

How do you safely collaborate with others in a UNIX environment in an on-going basis?

There are different locations where you can store files for the long term. The correct location to store files depends on several factors, including their size, how private they are, whether other users should be able to read or write them, and whether they should remain for your group after you have gone to another organization.

## UNIX Ownership & Permissions

You {==must==} understand the basics of file ownership and permissions to successfully share files. Here are some tutorials to read:

- https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/unix-file-permissions/
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-permission.htm
- https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-file-permissions-explained
- https://kb.iu.edu/d/abdb

### Important Concepts

Out of the basic information on this topic, these are some particular details you should understand. 

**umask**
: umask is a variable which controls the permissions assigned to files and directories that you create. You have a default umask, which can be changed for future logins if you change your `.bashrc` file. You can change the current umask at any time before you do run some commands.

**re-use of permission bits**
: There are nine basic permission bits for files and directories. Three each for owner, group, and other. As UNIX developed and new capabilities were needed, the authors added one more bit (used for setuid and setgid), then started adding multiple meanings to some bits. This is shown by the letter (and its capitalization) used to represent it in the output of the `ls -l` command.

: 

**read and execute bits on directories**
: The role of the read and execute bits on directories is somewhat different than that on files.  A directory is essentially a special kind of file, containing details about its contents. So you need to be able to read the directory in order to list its contents. On a directory, the execute bit means "search" or "traverse"

: Users _must_ have appropriate permissions on ALL of the parts of a path needed to reach a final file or directory. They don't need to be able to modify all of the parent directories, but they have to be able to descend through the tree of directories.

: **/dcs07/somegroup/data/src/compile.py**
: An example absolute path composed of four directories and a file. You cannot read the file unless the four directories and the file have appropriate permissions and group memberships. You can only modify the file if you have write permission on it. You can create other files in the same directory only if the `src` directory has the necessary writable bit enabled.

### UNIX Commands To Know

You can learn more about these commands by reading their manual page. You can run the command `man command-name` to read it locally. [Tips for reading manual pages](../help/images/guide-to-manual-pages.pdf) can be found in this PDF document.

Only some of the arguments needed are shown in this table.

|Command|Description|Notes|
|:---|:-----|----|
|ls -l|List file details|Lists both files & dirs|
|ls -ld|List dir details|-d option says not to list contents of dir|
|umask|Display or change umask|There are two versions, one built into bash and a standalone one /usr/bin/umask. The latter has a `-S` option which displays permissions in a more readable fashion.[^1]|
|id|Display your user & grp|Specify another user to see their info|
|chmod|Change permissions|use -R option for recursion|
|chgrp|Change grp of file or dir|use -R option for recursion|
|chown|Change owner of file or dir|Ask us to change ownership|
|newgrp -|Create new shell with different group|the hyphen option is useful|
|sg|Execute cmd with different grp||
|mkdir|Make a directory||
|touch|Create an empty file or modify time stamps on existing||

[^1]: To see the umask manual page which supports -S, use the command `man 1p umask` To use this version of the umask command, you need to specify the full path to it (/usr/bin/umask) instead of `umask`.

(To keep table size down, we used abbrieviations: dir for directories, grp for groups, cmd for command.)

## Access Control Lists - ACLs

Sometimes you want to give access to an individual or a group in ways that the traditional UNIX permissions and ownership model do not allow. You can use an ACL to grant those permissions, including 

See [this document](acl.md) for details on how to do this.

## **Where to share?**

### Project Space
The best place for long-term sharing of files, and the only place to share any significant volume of files, is in file systems created for research groups who purchase allocations of one of our storage servers.

If your need is temporary or you cannot purchase your own space, you might be able to secure permission from an existing owner to use their space. They will need to create a subdirectory within their allocation for you and change the permissions of the directories above that to allow you and your group to see into those directories. We are happy to create a new UNIX group so you can use it in your permissions scheme. Send the request with the desired group name and a list of member usernames to bitsupport.

### Home Directory

Everyone has a home directory. By default this is a private space. Things like SSH can break if the permissions on the home directory are set incorrectly.

You don't want to open up your home directory to everyone in the cluster by making your home directory group or world readable or writable. By default all users belong to the same group. It's not just that people you like and trust can see your files -- so can hackers if they get access to anyone's account. Your configuration files reveal details about your account, your accounts elsewhere and, if writable, allow hackers to set traps so they can become you. Then possibly access your home or other computers.

If you must use your home directory, please use ACLs to give specific access to specific people. We have written [an ACL document](../files/acl.md) to guide you. We are happy to create a new UNIX group so you can use it in your permissions scheme. Send the request with the desired group name and a list of member usernames to bitsupport.

### Scratch Space

If you need to _briefly_ share some files with someone and they are too large to send via email (say 5MB), you might consider placing them in shared scratch space. This is not recommended, but we want you to be informed about this choice before you make it.

If you and your recipient are members of some common group other than the default, it is best to make your temporary directory group readable and searchable but remove access for "other".

**/tmp**
: An acceptable place for a quick one-time _exchange_ of small files which don't contain protected info _IF YOU ARE CAREFUL_. This directory is world-readable and writable. A prime consideration is whether there is enough room in /tmp for your purpose. The operating system and other users depend on there ALWAYS being enough free space in this file system. Delete your files ASAP after the exchange.

**/fastscratch**
: An acceptable place for _exchanging_ larger files, but not for sharing over times longer than, say, a week. Everyone has a 1TB quota on this fast file system, but there is only 22TB of space. This space is meant to enable fast access to data read or written by jobs on the compute nodes. Files older than 30 days are deleted automatically. This document describes this file system in more detail.


### Group Writable Directories

Every file or directory has an owner and a group. Every user has a primary group, and can belong to one or more secondary groups.

#### Group sticky bit

When you want to make a directory tree group writable but also configure the SGID bit on directories, you cannot use a simple recursive chmod command. 

These commands are examples of how you can recursively set correct permissions. They use the `find` command to print path names to directories or files, then pass those to xargs to execute the given commands upon.  

```Shell
cd into-the-top-of-the-directory-tree
find . -type d | xargs chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,g+s,o-rwx
find . -type f | xargs chmod u+rwx,g+rw,o-rwx
```



## Creating A Group Writable Directory

!!! Warning "Raw Material Here"
    The following needs to be rewritten.

The list command, ls, is crucial to figuring out what is possible, where.
The long argument, -l, will show you ownership and permission information, as seen in my previous email.
Sometimes you also want to use the -d argument to tell ls that you want to see the information about a directory and not what is inside it.
 
So using ls -l  on /users/shared/55548/ will show you that many subdirectories are not group writable. Your failed efforts involve trying to create files or directories inside of directories that are group readable and searchable and sticky but not writable.
 
Every directory in a path to the destination needs to have suitable permissions.
Readability: every directory in the path /users/55548/shared/MA_switching needs to be readable by for you to be able to list its contents.
Writability: only the last directory in the path needs to be writable for you to be able to modify its contents.
 
jhpcecms01:/users/55548/shared# ls -l

Only the owner of a directory can change its permissions. So in this case c-aliu63-55548 needs to change the permissions on MA_switching to make it group writable.
This command run by them would change the directory:
chmod g+w /users/55548/shared/MA_Switching
This command run by them would change the directory and everything within it using the recursive flag:
chmod -R g+w /users/55548/shared/MA_Switching
 
Why are files and directories created with the permissions that they get?
A key factor here is the “umask” setting in the user’s environment when files and directories are being created.
The command “umask -S” will show you the permissions that will be used for new files and directories.
Here you see an example of my inspecting the contents of my umask setting and then changing it to make it such that when I create a file it will be group-writable.
If you want such a setting to be used in the future for all of your logins, you would add a line to the bottom of your .bashrc file in your home directory.
 
jhpcecms01:/users/55548/shared# umask -S
u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
jhpcecms01:/users/55548/shared# umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx
jhpcecms01:/users/55548/shared# umask -S
u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx
 
Many of the people modifying files in the shared directory may want to adjust the permissions of existing files and directories, and change their umask values. If they want directory trees to be group writable and new files or directories to be the same. Or some other set of permissions. Not everything within the shared directory needs to be shared with every other user of the DUA.
