# GPU Critical Knowledge

## Overview or Everything in One Document??

Should this be an overview. JRT thinks so, because he envisions a growing number of GPU-related documents instead of one massively long document.

## MIGRATE PREVIOUS WEB SITE DOCUMENT

Probably put some of it here, some of it into other document(s)
https://jhpce.jhu.edu/knowledge-base/gpus-on-the-jhpce-cluster/

## Our GPU Nodes
Table with their resources, and partition names.

## Using them

Dos and don'ts.

Is it all interactive? If not, provide some example batch job files.

Mark has written material and sent it to various people. Combine that with perhaps info from this
[Tensorflow sample document](https://hpc-docs.cubi.bihealth.org/how-to/software/tensorflow/)

Look for other resources out there containing advice about using GPUs in a SLURM context.
