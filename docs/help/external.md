# External References

The World Wide Web has been of incalculable benefit to humanity. We owe [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) an enormous debt of gratitude.

If you have suggestions for this page, please send the link(s) and your reasons for nominating it/them to bitsupport.


## CAVEAT EMPTOR

You need to consider whether what you're reading on an external web site applies to JHPCE. Policies and practices differ between clusters, as does available software and their versions.  Don't copy-and-paste blindly. Nonetheless, there is a wealth of information out there that you can apply to your work.

## SLURM Web Sites of Note

We are accumulating this information on [this page](../slurm/user-guide-collection.md).

We also have a [document](../slurm/slurm-commands-ref.md) with links to not only the vendor's documentation for each common command, but also pages we've written with advice and examples for some important commands.

## User tutorials

+ [R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/#.YI4g4GZKgdk) - this site has a wealth of information for improving your data science and teamwork skills. A real gem for people new to the field!
+ [Lieber Institute RStats club](https://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/)
+ [Leo Collado Torres YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LeonardoColladoTorres/playlists) including [JHPCE playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNNI62fcZPdAslHFllqv0-2iZqby1h0CV) - note that the JHPCE playlist starts off with videos featuring the Sung Grid Engine job scheduler, which has been replaced by SLURM in 2023. The data science contents of the SGE-containing videos may still be of interest.
+ [Lieber Institute module config](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jhpce_module_config) and [Lieber Institute module source code](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jhpce_module_source) - Lieber has generously built and maintains many software modules for JHPCE users
