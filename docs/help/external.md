# External References

What is the best of the web that we can guide our users towards?

How should this be organized?

Currently there are a number of pages with topic-specific links out to other web sites. Some of their info should remain on those pages. 

In other cases, perhaps after the references are used to write Good Pages, those sites may be good candidates to pull back to here as a general resource for some identified reason.

## FOLLOWING JUST YANKED IN FROM A PREVIOUS DOCUMENT

!!! Note
    Jeffrey has been putting pdf's into the images subdirectories found under each topic. He has found that creating symbolic links to actual files with dates in their names for example works. The MarkDown documents we write can refer to the well-chosen static file name and not have to be changed every time the actual document name changes.

## Resources description for Grant Applications
Move this information to somewhere under the "How to Join Us" topic?

This is a Microsoft Word document.

We should make a PDF version available. Also a Word version if there is formatting that people might want to copy and paste? But at least a PDF so users can read it without having to have a copy of Word.

This version contains inaccurate (SLURM, ssh access to transfer node is allowed, maybe other items) statements.
