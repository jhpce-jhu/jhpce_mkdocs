##JADE Overview

The JHPCE Advanced Data Enclave (JADE) is a secured, NIST 800-171 compliant
High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster managed by the Joint High Perfomance
Computing Exchange (JHPCE) organization. 

The JADE cluster is designed to provide researchers with a work environment 
which meets or exceeds the requirements for handling Controlled Unclassified
Information (CUI) data. The NIH requires NIST 800-171 compliance for 
[database of Genotypes and Phenotypes](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/) (dbGaP) datasets.

The JADE cluster also houses the JHU consolidated [Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov) (CMS) data managed by the 
[Health Analytics Research Platform]
(https://hbhi.jhu.edu/affiliate-resource/health-analytics-research-platform-harp)
(HARP) service center, which was formerly housed on the C-SUB cluster.

If you would like an account on the JADE cluster, where there is an existing DUA on JADE, please complete the [New Jade User Form](new-users-form.md)

If you have a new DUA that you would like to have hosted on on JADE, please complete the [New DUA Form](new-dua-form.md)

## Migration Into JADE
For users migrating from JHPCE or C-SUB to JADE, please see [the transition
material](transition/jade-transition.md) for information about changes in JADE.

## Getting Help

### Via email

The JHPCE systems administration team monitors two mailing lists for
queries, reports of issues and feedback. Please use the appropriate one.

*bitsupport@lists.jh.edu* is for account, SLURM, cluster, storage & login issues

*bithelp@lists.jh.edu* should be used for more complex application issues, such
as ones involving R, SAS, python, modules, etc. It is watched by not only the
systems administrators, but also members of the community who have contributed
tools like modules.

CMS users - please see below for where you should send CMS-specific requests.

### JHPCE web site

The JHPCE Service Center manages 3 HPC computing environments, the original
"JHPCE" cluster, the C-SUB and now JADE.

The [JHPCE web site](https://jhpce.jhu.edu) was created to describe the original
HPC cluster. When the C-SUB cluster was built, we added a few pages describing
some C-SUB-specific topics. Now that JADE exists, we will be adding
JADE-specific pages. 

The bulk of the web site about the original cluster will be of 
great use to JADE users, as it describes using the SLURM job scheduler,
working with various software packages, etc. However, readers will need
to interpret what they read and consider about whether applying it in JADE
requires any modification or re-interpretation.

You will find the search field (click on the magnifying lens in the upper right
corner to be helpful.  Also, see the navigation bar section titled "Getting Help"
