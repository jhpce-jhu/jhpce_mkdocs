# HIPAA
## Basics
HIPAA has two relevant standards that must be satisfied.  The HIPAA Security
Rule Standards and the HIPAA Privacy Rule Standards. The JHPCE adheres to the
HIPAA Security Rule Standards. Adhering to the HIPAA Privacy standards is the
responsibility of the PI.  BSPH is not part of the Johns Hopkins covered
entities (As of 1/26/06). Therefore, insofar as data on the JHPCE is concerned,
the PI is responsible for ensuring that his or her research is conducted in
compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule Standards. Fortunately, this is not
difficult. Formally, PIs are restricted to either
deidentified datasets or to limited datasets (see links below for details).
Examples of limited data sets include NHANES datasets  and deidentified insurance claim data 
(assuming a data use agreement is in place). The latter can
include dates such as admission, discharge, service, DOB, DOD; and location
information such as city, state, five digit or more zip code; and ages in
years, months or days or hours.

## Using PHI or PII on JHPCE
The JHPCE cluster may be able to meet the requirements specified by the data
provider for the handling of PHI data.  There may be additional steps that
the data analysts will need to go through in order to access the data, but this
is typically a matter of running a few extra steps to access the data.  If you
have a dataset with sensitive data, please reach out to us at [bitsupport@jhu.edu](mailto:bitsupport@jhu.edu?subject=HIPAA Inquiry")
and we can review the data handling requirements to assess whether the JHPCE
cluster can meet them.

## CSUB

The JHPCE maintains a small sub-cluster for handling CMS Medicare and Medicaid
claims data. This sub-cluster has a number of additional security features
in place to ensure the security of this more sensitive data. If you are
interested in accessing the CMS data, please email [support@harp-csub.freshdesk.com](mailto:support@harp-csub.freshdesk.com) for more information. We have
additional information in [our CSUB Section](../csub/csub-overview.md).
