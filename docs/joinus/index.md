<h3>The JHPCE Service Center manages 2 HPC computing environments.</h3>
## JHPCE
The larger HPC environmnet is for general HPC computing on non-HIPAA data.
We generally refer to this as the "J H P C E" cluster (each letter pronounced). 
Informaion on the JHPCE cluster can be found at the [Introduction](intro.md)
link.

## CSUB
We also manage a smaller sub-cluster for working on CMS Medicare and Medicaid
data. We refer to this cluster as the C-SUB (See Sub) cluster. While the JHPCE
service cnter manages this HPC cluster, it's operation is overseen by the [HARP](https://hbhi.jhu.edu/affiliate-resource/health-analytics-research-platform-harp)
organization in JHU. Technical infomation about the C-SUB can be found at the
[CSUB Overview](../csub/csub-overview/).
