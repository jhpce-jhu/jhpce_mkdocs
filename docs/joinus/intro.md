## Overview for new users or PIs
The JHPCE Cluster operates as a non-profit service center run out of the 
Biostats department of the Bloomberg JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health. As 
such we do charge fairly nominal fees for compute and storage useage, and all
users on the cluster need to have a sponsoring PI that will fund their usage.

## Information for New PIs
The JHPCE cluster is a Linux based environment, and is great for running
loosely coupled parallelizable jobs, or programs needing large amounts of 
CPUs, RAM, or disk space.  We have a number of genomics and statistical tools
installed on the cluster, but most of the analysis is done using programs 
written in languages like R, python, Stata, or SAS.

As menetioned above, we do operate as a non-profit JHU Service Center, and do
charge for **compute** and **storage** usage on the cluster.  

<details>
<summary>Compute Charges</summary>
Our fees for compute time are roughly 1 penny per hour for a job using 1 core 
and 5GB of RAM.  Costs scale linearly with time and cpu+mem usage, so a job 
running for 24 hours that used 8 cores and 40GB of RAM would cost about $2.00.
</details>

  <summary>Storage Charges </summary>
  Costs for storage are broken into home directory storage and project storage space. 
<br>
    1. **Home directory Storage:** All users are given a personal home directory with a 100GB quota.  For home directory space, we charge $0.45 per GB per year, so this cost would max out at $45 for a year if a user used their entire 100GB of space.
<br>
    2. <b>Project Storage:</b> If you need several TB of space for storing large amounts of data, you can purchase an allocation on one of our large storage arrays.  Every 12 months or so we purchase a new large storage array for the JHPCE cluster, and sell allocations on that array. The cost for an allocation will be based on the actual cost of the storage, but has been decreasing over time.  Our latest storage build worked out to be about $30 per TB per year.  There is typically a 10TB minimum buyin for new storage purchases.

If that sounds like a good fit for your lab, then the first step in accessing
the cluster would be for you or someone on your team to complete the <A HREF="new-pi.md">New Project form</A>  This will help us gather the relevant contact and financial information for your lab.


Once the New Project form is completed, weâ€™ll add your group as a Sponsoring Organization on the <A HREF="new-pi.md">New Project form</A> at which point the members of your team that will be performing the analysis can sign up for an account.  All new users are required to attend one of our JHPCE Orientation Sessions, held every other Wednesday afternoon, during which their account will be set up on the cluster.


JRT didn't put the c-sub info in this document.
(He was assuming that c-sub users would have their own page.)
In any case, maybe some of the c-sub material should be made a part of this page.

# Information for New Users
If you are prospective user, please start by getting the approval of a
PI who has established a Project with the JHPCE cluster. If you and they are both new to JHPCE, please ask ask your PI to visit [this page](new-pi.md).
Once your PI has a Project with JHPCE, you can request an account by filling out
the <A HREF="new-users.md">New Users form</A> 
Once you complete your form, you'll receive an introductory email, which will include a link to sign up for an upcoming orientation session.

## Orientation
We do require that all new users on the cluster attend a JHPCE Orientation Session.  The Orientation is typically held every other Wednesday afternoon, and lasts for about 2 hours.  Prior to attending the orientation, you should review the <A HREF="new-users.md">What to deo before attenting the orientation session</A> page.  The slides for the orientation can be found <A HREF="/orient/images/latest-orient.pdf">Here</A>
