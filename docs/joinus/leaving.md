So, you're leaving JHU.

# Departing Students/Researchers or PIs of Departing Students/Researchers
If you are a student or researcher that is either leaving JHU or will no
longer be using the JHPCE cluster, please be sure to have your sponsoring PI
reach out to us. We will work with your PI to close out your account on the
JHPCE cluster and either delete your data from the cluster, or migrate it to
another location. If you have data on the cluster that you are authorized to
keep, please be sure to transfer the data to a location outside of the cluster
so that you can access it once you account is closed. We have some tips on
transferring data to and from the cluster [here](../access/file-transfer.md)

We can keep your account open for a short time after you leave JHU if your PI
agrees to continue to sponsor your usage. Please have your PI reach out to us
at [bitsupport@lists.jhu.edu](mailto:bitsupport@lists.jhu.edu) so that we
can arrange your ongoing access to the cluster.

# Departing PIs/Departments
If you are a sponsoring PI and you are leaving JHU, or will no longer be using
the JHPCE cluster, please reach out to us at [bitsupport@lists.jhu.edu](mailto:bitsupport@lists.jhu.edu)
so that we can coordinate closing out your project. There will need to be a
number of decisions made about your account and data.

* Any users under your project will that will continue to use the JHPCE cluster
will need to be moved under another PI's project. We will need an "OK" from
the adopting PI in order to move anyone under their Project.
* All users that are not picked up by another sponsoring PI will have their
accounts closed and home directories deleted.
* If you have data stored in a larger DCL or DCS storage allocation, the
allocation will need to be either moved under another project, or deleted. As
with users, you will need to identify a new PI/Project that will assume
ownership of your storage allocation.
* Please be sure to transfer any data you will need to retain to a location
outside of the cluster so that you can access it once you account is closed.
