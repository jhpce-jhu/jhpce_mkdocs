# How to buy nodes for your research

This is the document for you. The cluster only exists because PIs bought nodes and collaborated. With more nodes, more research could be done, and faster.

JRT thinks that it this document and the heading in the nav bar should continue to be indictative of the idea he thinks we should be promoting, which is CONSIDER BUYING NODES. 

This can be called inside this document "becoming a stakeholder". But JRT thinks using that term in the nav bar is technically correct but **submerges** the ideas that should be in as many minds as possible:

* HEY, MAYBE I SHOULD URGE MY ADVISOR TO BUY A NODE
* DOES IT REALLY COST THAT MUCH TO GET A NODE?
* I'M GOING INTO A BUDGET MEETING, MAYBE I SHOULD BUY A NODE?
* I'M WRITING A GRANT PROPOSAL, MAYBE I SHOULD INCLUDE MONEY FOR BUYING NODES OR STORAGE!!

## Process 
How to go about it.

## Benefits

### How Your Jobs Are Prioritized

What JRT doesn't know what to say in this document:

* how do we help you get your work done preferentially despite the node being in the shared partition
* about how nodes need to be shared with everyone else. What expectations do we want to set? Do we want to explicitly start talking to the community about buying nodes that are managed but normally private rather than being normally shared?

## Example costs and configurations

how to characterize what kinds of balances favor what kinds of workloads? Do we even go there unless we are going to start hosting co-located private-by-default nodes?

compute node examples. provide a few recent price points. Any value in mentioning these variations?

* favors CPUs?
* favors RAM?
* local scratch storage space??? we could make a UNIX-group-controlled local scratch for only PI members to use instead of the all-purpose, all-user /scratch concept.

GPU node example cost and configuration (warning about lead times for GPU components??)
