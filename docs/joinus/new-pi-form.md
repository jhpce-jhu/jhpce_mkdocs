The JHPCE cluster is a fee-for-service HPC facility provided by the Biostatistics department in the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health.  The facility is open to all Johns Hopkins affiliated researchers, and we do charge fairly nominal fees for compute time and storage used . All researchers must have a valid JHU IO number to charge usage against, or have a Sponsoring PI that will fund their research. 

Computing fees vary depending which queue is being used, but the effective rate on the “shared queue” is currently hovering around $0.01/cpu-hour..  Users affiliated with particular stakeholders can access the corresponding dedicated queue(s). Non-stakeholders can only access the shared queue and non-dedicated storage.  Effective rates on dedicated queues are generally lower.

Storage fees vary depending on which device your data resides. The effective rate on the home file system is approximately $345/TB-year but is limited to 100GB/user, so this should max out at about $35/user/year. The lowest cost storage belongs to stakeholders who have invested in dedicated project space. The rate for this space allocations is around $20/TB-year.

We build a new storage system roughly very year.  We advise potential storage stakeholders to let us know well ahead of time of their expected needs so that we can include them when it comes time to plan the next build. 

The facility operates as a “common pool resource” in the sense formalized by E. Ostrom and others. Users affiliated with stakeholders have the right of priority access to the resources that they “own”. All users, whether they are members of a stakeholding organization or not, are otherwise treated identically. Excess computing capacity is made available to the entire community via a low priority “shared queue”. The shared queue provides surge capacity to stakeholders and and access to HPC resources to non-stakeholders. 

New PIs typically will join as non-stakeholder members, and the researchers they sponsor will have access to the "shared" queue on the JHPCE cluster.  This is typically sufficient for students and samll to mid-sized projects that need HPC resources. 

If your usage of the cluster is at a level where you at times need dedicated resources for your workload or workflow, you can become a stakeholder by purchasing compute nodes for the cluster. Stakeholder are still charged management fees for the nodes that they provide, but these fees are defrayed to the extent that their capacity is used by others. There is no guarantee that non-stakeholders will have sufficient capacity to perform their research. Historically, however there has almost always been sufficient capacity for all the users. 

In this way the system has been able to meet the needs of both the stakeholders with the greatest HPC consumption, and the needs of the smaller users in the long tail of HPC consumption (where the bulk of the science is performed). All this is accomplished with light-weight polices and light-weight organizational infrastructure (about 2FTEs) , which is a major reasons that we are able to keep our costs low.

Users install their own apps. Given the heterogeneity of the community, it is not practical to provide application support. Instead we enable the community with a help list.
