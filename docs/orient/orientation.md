JRT thinks that such file should live in docs/orient/images/




Can we make the link point to a filename which represents the latest version? Which would be a static file name implemented as a symbolic link to the name of the actual latest document?

Alternatively, could we perhaps adopt the practice of copying what ever is the latest to a single name? To simplify web site maintenance going forward.

Otherwise any time we change a document name, we'll need to successfully (accurately) search all of the documents in the web site looking for the correct string, then update each file.
