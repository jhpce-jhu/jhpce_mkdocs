# Database Catalog

The JHPCE Data Catalog provides a way to browse and search an online collection of data sets generated at JHU as well as publicly available ones.

The goals of the JHPCE Data Catalog are:

* Provide a central place for JHU generated data
* Facilitate the collaboration between different JHU Departments
* Help JHU researchers idenfity data sets that relevant to their work

The catalog does not store the data sets but rather provides an index of available ones to help researchers identify data sets pertinent to their work.

!!! Warning
    This is being developed. Please send suggestions about functional matters to bitsupport. After further refinement we will welcome contributions to the database itself.

Access requires a JHED credential and a computer that is on campus or using the VPN.
