# Introduction to SLURM

Until we write this document, please

1. see the latest [orientation document (pdf)](../orient/images/latest-orient.pdf)
2. check out other SLURM-related pages on this web site. There is already some great information here. The [commands tip and reference](../slurm/slurm-commands-ref.md) document contains links to both manual pages and pages we've written with guidance and examples.
3. If you can't find what you are looking for here, we have a collection of good documentation from other clusters [here](../slurm/user-guide-collection.md). SLURM is a popular tool, so Google searches will also be productive.
