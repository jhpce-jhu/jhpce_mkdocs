# Node Features

JHPCE has a wide variety of compute nodes. Some have GPU processors, some have large amounts of memory, and there are many models of CPUs present.

SLURM allows for the assignment of keywords to nodes so that users can guide their jobs to appropriate machines. This is, of course, in addition to the other methods of indicating resource needs, such as desired partition(s), amount of memory, and the need for a GPU.

These keywords are up to systems administrators to choose and define. 

## CPU Models

The GNU C/C++ compiler suite is the most commonly used one for those languages.
