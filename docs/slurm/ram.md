## Requesting Additional Memory
All jobs need to use a certain amount of Memory or RAM (We use the terms Memory and RAM interchangeably) in order
to run.
By default on the JHPCE cluster when you submit a job with sbatch, or run srun, you are allotted 5GB of RAM   
for your job. 

If you are running a larger job and need more than the 5GB of RAM, you can request more (or less) RAM 
via 2 options:
```console
    --mem : memory per node (for all cores used)
    --mem-per-cpu : memory per core (harder to accurately estimate)
```
Some examples of using these options:
```console
sbatch --mem=10G job1.sh
```
- This would give your batch job a total of 10GB of RAM
```console
srun --mem-per-cpu=5G --cpus-per-task=4 --pty --x11 bash
```
- This would give your interactive session a total of 20GB of RAM and 4 cores

## Estimating RAM usage
There is, sadly, no easy formula to know ahead of time how much RAM a job will need when working
with large data. Every program has its own way of dealing with RAM. It may sometimes be an iterative process
to determine the best value to use for your jobs.  Here are some tips to help find good values for your job:
- You can run a test job on a small subset of data.  From here you should be able to extrapolate the amount
of RAM your full job will need.
- One good place to start is to look at the size of the files you will be
reading in. Add a bit extra, as a starting point.  So if your job is reading in a 20GB image file, you
may want to ask for 25GB or RAM.
- You can run sacct to gather info on a completed job:
sacct -o JobID,JobName,ReqTRES%40,MaxVMSize,MAXRSS,State%20 -j JOBID
- If the "STATE" from the above command is "OUT_OF_MEMORY" it means that you job has run out of RAM, and
you will need to resubmit your job with a larger RAM request.
- Use ```slurmpic``` to see the current core and RAM availability,
and plan accordingly

Try to make your RAM request slightly higher than your expected usage.
   - Too low and your job will get killed for exceeding your request
   - Too high and your job may take longer to get scheduled, plus youâ€™ll be squatting on RAM that others can use.
