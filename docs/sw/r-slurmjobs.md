It includes functions for creating submittable jobs (including array jobs), monitoring partitions, and extracting info about running or complete jobs.

R is an open-source statistical environment which can be easily modified to enhance its functionality via packages. 

slurmjobs is a R package available via the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) repository for packages. R can be installed on any operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) after which you can install slurmjobs
