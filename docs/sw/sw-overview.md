# SOFTWARE TOPIC - page to develop outline

## What we've installed & how to use it
### Overview
### Modules
### In the operating system
Is there anything useful to say about what's available to people outside of what they see listed by `module avail`?

### Suggested programs for GUI use
Jeffrey includes in C-SUB orientation [a table of GUI programs](images/helpful-gui-example.pdf) people might find useful, particularly those new to UNIX and the CLI.

There's an open github issue about whether to install some of those C-SUB tools on the JHPCE cluster.

### Software by category
We don't have to aim for a complete and frequently updated list. But we might give folks pointers to some important tool sets. Maybe our bithelp members can help write this document/section.

Example from [C.E.C.I](https://support.ceci-hpc.be/doc/_contents/UsingSoftwareAndLibraries/SoftwareInstalled/categories_items.html)

## How to add your own packages to R and python
Mark seems to think that we don't need to provide much in the way of instructions to users on building software. But JRT feels that this subtopic, at least, deserves a document.

[Here is a starter document](adding-pkgs.md) about adding your needed packages to existing python and R modules.

## Building your own software
If we don't write much beyond the adding-pkgs-to-the-two-popular-interpreted-languages, perhaps this section or document merely provides links to the work of others.

JRT thinks that people who have spent decades building software from source may be underestimating what younger people know.  We want to facilitate our users getting going, gaining proficiency. Part of what we want to differentiate us from other options is that we are more helpful than cold and impersonal organizations.

[Here is a starter document](building-from-src.md) about building your own software.

## GPU Information
Point to documents in that section. JRT created an [overview document](../gpu/gpu-overview.md) as a starting point.
