# Are you a Primary Investigator wanting to join JHPCE?

PULL MATERIAL IN FROM [EXISTING WEB SITE POLICIES PAGE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/policies/)

## Do we need a C-SUB Version?
If so it should live in the "csub" directory with all of the other csub-specific files.

## Benfits/sales pitch

## How to register

If you are a Principal Investigator registering a new project or
organization, please fill out [this
orm](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/register/project/#form). If you have never
registered a project and budget number with the JHPCE, we request that
you contact the director of the JHPCE to arrange a 1/2 hour
orientation (either in person or via telephone).

## Becoming a stakeholder
You can buy one or more nodes. See [this document](new-node.md).

## Please cite JHPCE in your papers

## How to budget for future JHPCE expenses?
Maybe some of our PIs can tell us whether there is anything PIs should know from this angle.
