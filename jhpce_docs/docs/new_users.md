# Registration

## For Principal Investigators

If you are a Principal Investigator registering a new project or
organization, please fill out [this
form](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/register/project/#form). If you have never
registered a project and budget number with the JHPCE, we request that
you contact the director of the JHPCE to arrange a 1/2 hour
orientation (either in person or via telephone).

## For New Users

If you are prospective user, please start by getting the approval of a
PI who has provided us with a budget number. Then request a user
account by filling out [this
form](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/register/user/).  Once we have received
your form, the JHPCE management team will contact you to schedule your
attendance at the next JHPCE Orientation.  All new users are required
to attend a 1 1/2 hour orientation session. Orientations are generally
scheduled every other week.
