This fee-for-service core is a long-standing collaborative effort between Biostatistics and the Computational Biology &amp; Research Computing group in the department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. The facility is open to all Johns Hopkins affiliated researchers.</p> <p>The facility is used primarily by labs and research groups in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (SPH), the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (SOM) and the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD). We have over 800 user accounts, 400 active users and approximately 100 unique users per quarter.</p> <p>The computing and storage systems are optimized for genomics and biomedical research. The cluster has 72 compute nodes, providing over 4000 cores, 30TB of DRAM and over 14 PB of networked mass storage. Networked mass storage uses open-source file systems (ZFS and Lustre-over-ZFS) and custom-built hardware. The latter includes a 5 PB of Lustre file system space that may be the lowest-cost and lowest-power parallel file system on the planet. We also have a 2PB disk-to-disk backup system for backing up more critical data.</p> <p>The JHPCE cluster is optimized for the embarrassingly parallel applications that are the bread-and-butter of our stakeholders, e.g., genomics and statistical applications, rather than the tightly-coupled applications that are typical in traditional HPC fields, e.g., physics, fluid-dynamics, quantum simulation etc. The network fabric consists of a 10 Gbps ethernet. The facility is connected via a 40Gbps network to the University\u2019s Science DMZ. Job scheduling is performed with Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM).</p> <p>The JHPCE operates as a formal Common Pool Resource (CPR) Hierarchy with rights to specific resources based on stakeholder ownership of resources. To benefit the entire research community, excess computing capacity is made available to non-stakeholders on an as-available basis, in exchange for fees that defray the operating costs of the stakeholders.</p> <p>If your lab is interested in joining the JHPCE community, either as a stakeholder or as a non-stakeholder, please contact the directors (jhpce@jhu.edu) to determine whether we can accommodate your needs.</p> <p>If your lab is already a member, and you need to add new users, then have the users fill out the JHPCE new user request form.</p> <p>Mark Miller and Brian Caffo Co-Directors, JHPCE</p>"},{"location":"access/access-overview/","title":"Accessing the Cluster: Overview","text":""},{"location":"access/access-overview/#cluster-structure-overview","title":"Cluster structure overview","text":"<p>Basically the cluster consists of some public-facing hosts and then resources isolated from other networks.

At this point you\u2019ll see a URL with \u201chttp://127.0.0.1\u201d in the address, and get a message \u201cWaiting for code\u2026\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Also at this point, the Firefox browser should open a new tab, and start going to the http://127.0.0.1 address, which should redirect you to the Microsoft login page.</p> <p></p> <p>From here, you should enter \u201cJHEDID@jh.edu\u201d. Where of course you specify your own JHEDID. You will then be sent to the familiar \u201cJohns Hopkins\u201d JHED Login screen, where you should enter your JHED password.</p> <p></p> <p>When prompted to \u201cSave your login\u201d, you should select \u201cDon\u2019t Save\u201d. You should then see in the Firefox display, a \u201cSuccess!\u201d message, and in your \u201csrun\u201d session, you should see the message \u201cGot code\u201d, and then a selection of OneDrive site options. You should select option \u201c1\u201d for \u201conedrive\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>Next, you should see a message where you can select which drive to use. There should only be one drive, so select \u201c0\u201d. You will also get a confirmation message, and you should select \u201cy\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>At this point a summary of the configuration will be displayed, and you should select \u201cy\u201d to accept the configuration.

For example, if you want to set a default group ACL where the group has write access, you need to make sure that your umask is set to <code>0002</code> rather than <code>0022</code>, as the \u201c2\u201d in the group umask bit will prevent the group write capability.</li> <li>ACL commands should be run on a compute node and not a login node.

R works just fine for me on the cluster! A) On the JHPCE cluster we have historically had several ways to run R programs.  Often  people will use the text-based version of R to run programs, and that works well for a lot of people.  Some people prefer to work in a graphical environment, so we also have the X11-based \u201cRstudio\u201d available on the cluster, which is great, except that on a slower network connection, this can get quite laggy.  The web based Rstudio Server provides the same graphical version available in Rstudio, but over a much lighter network protocol than the X11-based Rstudio, so it is much faster and more responsive to use.</p> <p>Q) Why not just set up a dedicated web server to run Rstudio Server like I had back at ZZZZ? A) Rstudio Server does not play well with clusters.  For us to run a dedicated Rstudio Server server, we would need to purchase a fairly large system with lots of RAM and CPU power.  This was considered, but in the end was deemed cost prohibitive, and it didn\u2019t allow the use of the JHPCE cluster resources to run R programs.  This solution allows the nice web-based Rstudio Server to be used, while making use of the existing CPU and RAM resources available on the cluster.</p> <p>Q) My program can\u2019t run because it needs XXX package! A) The R that is run within the Rstudio Server is completely separate  from the default version of R that is used on the JHPCE cluster, therefor you may need to install packages using the install.packages() function, or through the Rstudio Server GUI .</p> <p>Q) I forgot to cleanly disconnect from the Rstudio Server/My session got disconnected. A) This should be fine.  Your interactive srun session will eventually time out and will kill the Rstudio Server that was running.  You may get warning messages about ports being in use \u2013 if so, please wait a few minutes and try again.</p> <p>Q) When I try to add the port forward, I get an error message about \u201cPort is in use\u201d.  How do I fix this? A) You can only run one instance of Rstudio Server. You likely have another SSH session running that has the port forward lingering.  If you had been using Rstudio Server in another SSH session, you will need to either need to log out of that ssh session, or run the \u201c~C\u201d \u201c-KL XXXXX\u201d command to tear down the port forward.</p> <p>If you have any questions  about using Rstudio Server, please feel free to email us at bitsupport.</p>","tags":["in-progress"]},{"location":"sw/sw-overview/","title":"SOFTWARE TOPIC - page to develop outline","text":""},{"location":"sw/sw-overview/#what-weve-installed-how-to-use-it","title":"What we've installed &amp; how to use it","text":""},{"location":"sw/sw-overview/#overview","title":"Overview","text":""},{"location":"sw/sw-overview/#modules","title":"Modules","text":""},{"location":"sw/sw-overview/#in-the-operating-system","title":"In the operating system","text":"<p>Is there anything useful to say about what's available to people outside of what they see listed by <code>module avail</code>?</p>"},{"location":"sw/sw-overview/#suggested-programs-for-gui-use","title":"Suggested programs for GUI use","text":"<p>Jeffrey includes in C-SUB orientation a table of GUI programs people might find useful, particularly those new to UNIX and the CLI.</p> <p>There's an open github issue about whether to install some of those C-SUB tools on the JHPCE cluster.</p>"},{"location":"sw/sw-overview/#software-by-category","title":"Software by category","text":"<p>We don't have to aim for a complete and frequently updated list.
