A key thing to know is that JHPCE uses a Kerberos database to store user and group information, and that our NFSv4 (Network File System, version 4) file systems look to that Kerberos database for ownership and permission information. Kerberos databases can hold information for one or more domains.

Both programs and file systems have rules and limitations -- and bugs. It is best to be conservative when naming files.</p> <p>UNIX shells like bash, our default, interpret many characters that people have grown used to using in file names on their Windows or Mac computers as having special meanings. Ampersands, parentheses, vertical bars for example. Using other characters, such as spaces, require file names to be enclosed in single or double quotes or escaped with backslashes when provided to UNIX commands. Combining multiple commands which pass file names from one to the other either fail or require the use of special techniques.</p> <p>Instead of space characters, use hyphens or underscores.</p> <p>It is best to use the plain Latin alphabet. Accented characters or those which require Unicode to portray might be stored in the file system, but they may not be handled correctly by programs that try to manipulate them. If those failures are silent, then you may not understand what is happening or what failed to happen. For example, a file may not be added to an archive file, or if it is, might be hard to extract.</p> <p>There are limits to the length of file names (255 characters in most file systems) and program limits to the length of file paths (e.g. 4096 in Linux, 1024 in macOS).

Three each for owner, group, and other.

A directory is essentially a special kind of file, containing details about its contents. So you need to be able to read the directory in order to list its contents. On a directory, the execute bit means \"search\" or \"traverse\" Users must have appropriate permissions on ALL of the parts of a path needed to reach a final file or directory. They don't need to be able to modify all of the parent directories, but they have to be able to descend through the tree of directories. /dcs07/somegroup/data/src/compile.py An example absolute path composed of four directories and a file.

So in this case c-aliu63-55548 needs to change the permissions on MA_switching to make it group writable. This command run by them would change the directory: <code>chmod g+w /users/55548/shared/MA_Switching</code> This command run by them would change the directory and everything within it using the recursive flag: <code>chmod -R g+w /users/55548/shared/MA_Switching</code></p> <p>Why are files and directories created with the permissions that they get? A key factor here is the \u201cumask\u201d setting in the user\u2019s environment when files and directories are being created. The command \u201cumask -S\u201d will show you the permissions that will be used for new files and directories. Here you see an example of my inspecting the contents of my umask setting and then changing it to make it such that when I create a file it will be group-writable. If you want such a setting to be used in the future for all of your logins, you would add a line to the bottom of your .bashrc file in your home directory.</p> <p>jhpcecms01:/users/55548/shared# umask -S u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx jhpcecms01:/users/55548/shared# umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx jhpcecms01:/users/55548/shared# umask -S u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx</p> <p>Many of the people modifying files in the shared directory may want to adjust the permissions of existing files and directories, and change their umask values. If they want directory trees to be group writable and new files or directories to be the same. Or some other set of permissions. Not everything within the shared directory needs to be shared with every other user of the DUA.</p> <ol> <li> <p>There are 2 versions, one built into bash and a standalone one /usr/bin/umask. The latter has a <code>-S</code> option which displays permissions in a more readable fashion. The built-in only works with octal digits. To see the umask manual page which supports -S, use the command <code>man 1p umask</code> To use this version of the umask command, you need to specify the full path to it (/usr/bin/umask) instead of <code>umask</code>.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["in-progress","jeffrey"]},{"location":"gpu/alphafold/","title":"Alphafold","text":""},{"location":"gpu/alphafold/#alphafold","title":"Alphafold","text":"<p>The Alphfold software is available as a module on the jhpce cluster.</p> <p><pre><code>[login31 /users/mmill116/alpha1]$ srun --pty --x11 --mem=100G --cpus-per-task=8 --partition gpu --gpus=1 bash\n[compute-126 /users/mmill116/alpha1]$ module load alphafold\n(alphafold-gpu) [compute-126 /users/mmill116/alpha1]$ nvidia-smi    (this is to verify that you are assigned a GPU)\n(alphafold-gpu) [compute-126 /users/mmill116/alpha1]$ ls\nquery.fasta\n(alphafold-gpu) [compute-126 /users/mmill116/alpha1]$ cat query.fasta\n&gt;dummy_sequence\nGWSTELEKHREELKEFLKKEGITNVEIRIDNGRLEVRVEGGTERLKRFLEELRQKLEKKGYTVDIKIE\n(alphafold-gpu) [compute-126 /users/mmill116/alpha1]$ run_alphafold.sh -d /legacy/alphafold/data -o . -f query.fasta  -t 2020-05-14 -n 8\nI0305 14:37:51.029889 140001535510336 templates.py:857] Using precomputed obsolete pdbs /legacy/alphafold/data/pdb_mmcif/obsolete.dat.\nI0305 14:37:52.841140 140001535510336 xla_bridge.py:353] Unable to initialize backend 'tpu_driver': NOT_FOUND: Unable to find driver in registry given worker: \nI0305 14:37:52.984758 140001535510336 xla_bridge.py:353] Unable to initialize backend 'rocm': NOT_FOUND: Could not find registered platform with name: \"rocm\".

Your shell (such as bash) interprets this location as starting with the root of the file systems on a computer. See also: relative path ACE Access Control Entry. A component of an ACL. See our ACL document. ACL Access Control List. A collection of ACEs associated with a file or directory. Used to extend the normal UNIX permission scheme. See our ACL document. bash An example of a shell, which are programs which accept and process commands entered via text with a certain syntax, or set of rules. (Wikipedia page) CLI Command Line Interface - a program like bash which provides a means to enter commands via text strings and see responses. (Wikipedia page.) Cluster A collection of computers (aka \"nodes\") managed as a group to provide services. Usually uses a job scheduler. Compute node Computers within a cluster used to execute jobs Computer You're using one right now. Aren't they marvelous? Core A component of a CPU which processes threads of program instructions. Cores each have their own collections of components which are needed to execute instructions, such as registers for mathematical operations, memory stores to cache information. CPUs can contain many cores. Cores can have support for hyperthreading. (Wikipedia page. SLURM support for cores/threads.) CPU Acronym for Central Processing Unit. The main processor in a computer. Contains one or more cores. There may be more than one CPU within a computer. See information about the CPUs on your UNIX computer with the command <code>less /proc/cpuinfo</code> (press q to quit). (Wikipedia page) Current working directory Expansion of acronym CWD. Your current (aka present) location within a file system. Can be expressed as a path. The command <code>pwd</code> will return the path to your CWD. EMACS A super-complex but powerful and VERY extensible text editor written in Lisp, an abomination of a computer language. I called it \"Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping\" back in the day when a megabyte of RAM cost thousands and thousands of dollars. Like Doctor Who, proponents can be tiresome to others. See also: vi File system A data storage service which allows for the storage and retrieval of information. File systems are basic units of storage. File system services include holding metadata about files, such as when they were created and who owns them. The command <code>df -h .</code> will return information about the file system of your current working directory. (Wikipedia page) GUI Acronym for Graphic User Interface. Antonym of CLI. A means of interacting with a user via windows. Operating systems such as macOS and Windows rely on GUI for its ease-of-use. X11 is a protocol which provides for the display of GUI windows over networks. Some of the windows in a GUI might be terminals offering CLI programs, such as bash shells.  Hyperthreading Modern CPU cores normally have some additional circuitry which store information used by (normally two) threads. This allows the core to easily switch its attention between two threads so work can continue if one of the threads needs to wait for information to be brought into the core from RAM. (Wikipedia page) Job A unit of work given to an operating system by a scheduler on behalf of a user Job scheduler Application which controls the execution of interactive or batch jobs on a cluster. SLURM is a job scheduler. (Wikipedia page) Linux A flavor of UNIX. Don't let them convince you that they invented it. (They will try. It's sad, really.) locality The proximity of data stored in memory to the processing circuitry. You want to keep data as close as possible when creating jobs. Memory General term for anything that can store information. You have a memory. Computers use many types of memory. People often mean RAM when they say memory. Sometimes they mean hard drive space when they say memory, which is understandable but confusing to those trying to help them. Say \"disk space\" or \"disk storage\" instead. Thanks. Memory hierachy A hierarchy of types of memory used by a computer. Each type has different speed of access, capacity, and cost. Fast memory is expensive and usually provides for limited capacity. Each is therefore usually used for certain purposes. A register inside of a core inside of a CPU is the fastest memory, but small. Next is one or more caches inside of a core. Next (cheapest, fastest, most capacious) is RAM. After RAM comes hard drives on the same computer. After hard drives on the local computer comes hard drives on file servers which have to pass their information across the network. Next come USB sticks, then floppy disks, then humans typing into keyboards. The closer to a register you can keep the information needed for your program, the faster it can be processed. This distance from the processor is called locality. Pane (Associate with window) A subdivision within a window where information is displayed, perhaps alone or perhaps alongside other panes Path A string of characters used to identify a location in a directory structure inside of a file system. That location represents either a file or directory. Examples: <code>./my-script</code> or <code>/dcs07/a-groups-data/some/place/down/deep</code> See also: absolute path, current working directory, relative path. Node Any computer within a cluster Nodes can be grouped by the services they provide, such as offering computation or file services. Usually used to indicate a compute node. RAM Acronym for Read Access Memory. Part of a memory hierarchy. A form of computer memory that can be read or written in any order. Contrast with data stored on a tape. You cannot read any data from the tape without moving the tape to reach the portion where your desired information is stored. Some of us had to use data on tapes. We were lucky we didn't have to use data stored on punchcards. RAM is fast and capacious. Most RAM used in cluster nodes is volatile -- it cannot store information without continuous electrical power. (Wikipedia page) Relative path A path which does not start with a forward slash. Your shell (such as bash) interprets this location starting with your current working directory. See also: absolute path Scheduler A component of a job scheduler application which decides which jobs to start running, when, and on which cores on which CPUs on which nodes. (Operating systems also contain schedulers, which do the same things for any process or thread, whether or not they are part of a job.) (SLURM CPU allocation process described here. SLURM has multiple other documents in the Slurm Scheduling section of this page.) SSH Acronym for Secure SHell. Technically a protocol for multiple network services. Usually meant to refer to a program which implements that protocol to provide a CLI. See our SSH document. (Wikipedia page) Thread The smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently. Part of a process (which may have one or more threads). It takes time for the information needed by a thread to run to be loaded into a CPU core. So there is an expense (delay) to switching between threads on the same core. Hyperthreading attempts to reduce that cost. (Wikipedia page. SLURM support for cores/threads.) UNIX A family of operating systems initially brought to you by Bell Telephone, a monopoly in the US. UNIX has fundamentally always used a CLI because, well, GUIs didn't exist for many years after UNIX got started. UNIX has a steep learning curve, but has only grown in use over the decades because it is powerful and extensible. If you're struggling to learn UNIX, remember that many people had to learn UNIX without the Internet or Google. Modern macOS and Windows (since Windows NT) rely on UNIX code. Linux is not UNIX. Linux is a flavor of UNIX. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a poser. (Wikipedia page) User You Vi The best text editor. Anyone who tells you otherwise is uninformed.

For home directory space, we charge $0.45 per GB per year, so this cost would max out at $45 for a year if a user used their entire 100GB of space.  2.

We define Stakeholder PIs as those that have contributed computing resources to the  facility.  Non-Stakeholder PIs are those that sponsor the computing for their lab or department, but do not purchase computing resources for the cluster. Most PIs will start as Non-Stakeholders, but will move up to stakeholders when they either acquire computing resources they want to contribute to the cluster, or purchase computing resources for the cluster either through a grant or through their normal budgeting cycle. </p> <p>As a Stakeholder, you agree to share any unused capacity on your compute nodes with the broader JHPCE community by placing them on the \"shared\" partition or queue on the cluster. For non-Stakeholders, the only access to computing resources is via those shared by the Stakeholders.  This model has historically worked very well for the JHPCE community.  While there is no guarantee of computing resources to Non-Stakeholders, there is generally sufficient capacity on the \"shared\" partition to meet the needs of the users sponsored by Non-Stakeholders. </p> <p>This model is often referred to as a \u201ccommon pool resource\u201d in the sense formalized by E. Ostrom and others. Users affiliated with stakeholders have  the right of priority access to the resources that they \u201cown\u201d. All users, whether they are members of a stakeholding organization or not, are otherwise treated identically. Excess computing capacity is made available to the entire community via a low priority \u201cshared queue\u201d. The shared partition also provides surge capacity to stakeholders in addition to providing access to HPC resources to non-stakeholders.</p> <p>The JHPCE service center will charge a monthly management fee to the Stakeholder PI that has purchased computing nodes for the cluster.  This fee is roughly $500 per month for a compute node (which works out to $0.01/hr for a node with 64 cores and 512GB of RAM), and covers the charges for space, power, and cooling, as well as the salaries of those supporting the equipment.  These Stakeholder fees though are defrayed to the extent that their capacity is used by others. So if the users sponsored by a Stakeholder PI do not use their compute nodes for a month, that monthly fee is paid for entirely by its usage on the \"shared\" partition.</p> <p>In this way the system has been able to meet the needs of both the stakeholders with the greatest HPC consumption, and the needs of the smaller users in the long tail of HPC consumption (where the bulk of the science is performed). All of this is accomplished with light-weight polices and light-weight organizational infrastructure (&lt; 3FTEs) , which is a major reasons that we are able to keep our costs low.</p>"},{"location":"joinus/new-pi/#how-to-register","title":"How to register","text":"<p>If you are a Principal Investigator registering a new project or organization, please fill out this Form.

Instead the requirement is that either rates be fixed periodically OR a well defined systematic charge-back methodology be applied uniformly to all users. We employ the latter strategy. Expense sharing and rate calculations are performed with a software tool that creates a hierarchical model of the HPC facility and incorporates institutional subsidies, expenses and depreciation schedules to calculate the operating costs assigned to individual resources. The software tool then combines the operating costs with the usage data from system logs to calculate rates and chargebacks for individual resources and users. The JHPCE bills quarterly. To guarantee that the service center exactly recovers all it\u2019s quarterly expenses, the JHPCE uses retrospectively calculated rates which are based on actual quarterly expenses and actual quarterly usage (see discussions below).

By construction, the resulting rates lag the realities of the service center, i.e. the actual expenses, resource usage and configuration. This lag leads to the buildup of deficits (and occasionally surpluses). The resulting uncertainty causes organizational inertia that resists change and innovation. PIs demand and deserve predictable costs. They ask for the current \u201crate schedule\u201d. Unfortunately, setting fixed rates one year ahead actually leads to more variability than rates that are adjusted quarterly in response to \u201crealities on the ground\u201d.

Capital expenses are depreciated across 3-5 year intervals as determined by their asset class. Non-capital expenses are spread across 12 months, even if the interval spans two fiscal years. Thus the impact of large expenses is spread across individual fiscal years. Expenses are allocated to the appropriate sub-hierarchy of the resource hierarchy according to the part of the resource hierarchy that incurs the expense. This is performed with the aid of a formal graphical model of the facility. For example, expenses related to storage would be assigned to the storage-related sub-hierarchy. Thus the storage expense would not directly impact compute-related rates. In general, this allows expenses to be allocated to the subset of users who actually need and use particular resources. As resources are added and removed from the JHPCE facility, in response to waxing and waning research initiative and grant funding of particular stakeholders and users, the costs associated with those changes are shared with the appropriate subset of the JHPCE community. Finally, subsidies are applied at the level of the hierarchy that is required by the donor.

The only exception has been when major system upgrades have occurred. To PIs that are initially uncomfortable with retrospective rates, we point out that charges are the product of two terms: rates and usage. The latter is the dominant source of uncertainty in budget estimation. Our system allows PIs to use historical rates from recent quarters to estimate their computing budgets in grant applications. By smoothing and appropriate allocation of expenses, we are able to create highly stable rates and to substantially reduce quarterly fluctuations to only a few percent. The final advantage of the retrospective system is that since the software reconciles the budget on a quarterly basis, the service center knows on a quarterly basis, exactly where it stands financially.

You can tell that a job has been terminated due to exceeding its time limit by noting that the \u201cState\u201d in the output of \u201csacct\u201d is \u201cTIMEOUT\u201d, or noting the a line like \u201cslurmstepd: error: *** JOB 123456 ON compute-123 CANCELLED AT 2024-02-13T12:03:27 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***\u201d in the SLURM output file.</p> <pre><code>[mmill116@login31 class-scripts]$ cat script1\n #!/bin/bash\n # Test script for JHPCE cluster\n date\n echo \"I am now running on compute node:\"\n hostname\n SLEEPTIME=$((20 + $RANDOM % 60))\n echo \"Sleeping \" $SLEEPTIME \" seconds...\"\n sleep $SLEEPTIME\n date\n echo \"Done...\"\n exit 0 \n[mmill116@login31 class-scripts]$ sbatch -a 1-10%4 -t 00:00:30 script1\nSubmitted batch job 1980474 \n\n[mmill116@login31 class-scripts]$ sacct -j 1980474\n JobID           JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode \n ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- \n 1980474_1       script1     shared      jhpce          2  COMPLETED      0:0 \n 1980474_1.b+      batch                 jhpce          2  COMPLETED      0:0 \n 1980474_1.e+     extern                 jhpce          2  COMPLETED      0:0 \n 1980474_2       script1     shared      jhpce          2    TIMEOUT      0:0 \n 1980474_2.b+      batch                 jhpce          2  CANCELLED     0:15\n\n. . .\n\n[mmill116@login31 class-scripts]$ cat slurm-1980474_2.out\nTue Feb 13 12:02:19 PM EST 2024\nI am now running on compute node:\ncompute-093.cm.cluster\nSleeping  71  seconds...\nslurmstepd: error: *** JOB 1980476 ON compute-093 \nCANCELLED AT 2024-02-13T12:03:27 DUE TO TIME LIMIT *** \n</code></pre>","tags":["in-progress","slurm"]},{"location":"slurm/time-limits/#backfill-scheduler-strategies","title":"Backfill Scheduler Strategies:","text":"<p>SLURM\u2019s backfill scheduler introduces an additional layer of sophistication to job scheduling.

For example, if a higher priority job needs 30 cores and it will have to wait 20 hours for those resources to be available, if a lower priority job only needs a couple cores for an hour, Slurm will run that shorter job in the meantime. This GREATLY enhances utilization of the cluster.</p> <p>For this reason, it is important to request accurate walltime limits for your jobs.

So, my .bash_history file is 586,047 bytes in size.</p> <p>You can also use the <code>du</code> (disk usage) command to find the total disk space usage for files and directories.  By default, the <code>du</code> command will report the size of the file files in KB.  For example: <pre><code>[login31 /users/mmill116]$ du .bash_history\n229 .bash_history\n</code></pre> reports that my .bash_history is using 229KB of space. Now, you may have noticed that the output of <code>du</code> doesn't match the value shown in <code>ls -l</code>. This is due to the fact that most of the storage systems on JHPCE use native ZFS compression to minimize the amount of actual disk space a file is using. So, if you want to see how much disk space a file is using without the compression you would add the <code>--apparent-size</code> option to your  <code>du</code> command. <pre><code>[login31 /users/mmill116]$ du --apparent-size .bash_history \n573 .bash_history\n</code></pre> This shows us a value that more closely matches the value from the <code>ls</code> command (586047 bytes / 1024 bytes/KB = 573 KB).</p> <p>You can also add the <code>-h</code> option to the <code>du</code> command to show human-readable units. This is helpful when dealing with files that are many GBs in size. <pre><code>[login31 /users/mmill116]$ du --apparent-size -h .bash_history \n573K    .bash_history\n</code></pre></p> <p>Another commonly used option is the <code>-s</code> option.  This is typically used on directories, and will sum up the total amount of disk space used by all of the files within the directory, and all subdirectories therein. <pre><code>[login31 /users/mmill116]$ du -sh --apparent-size R\n^C\n[login31 /users/mmill116]$ srun --pty bash\nsrun: job 4707899 queued and waiting for resources\nsrun: job 4707899 has been allocated resources\n[compute-048 /users/mmill116]$ time du -sh --apparent-size R\n4.9G    R\n\nreal    4m49.219s\nuser    0m0.406s\nsys 0m7.840s\n</code></pre> Note that this can take quite a long time to run on directories with a lot of files or subdirectories in them. In the above example, I started the <code>du</code> command on the login node, and after a minute I cancelled it, logged into a compute node, and ran it from the compute node, so as not to put a heavy IO load on the login node.</p> <p>It took nearly 5 minutes to run, and found that the files in my R directory are using about 4.9GB  of actual space.  I ran this again without the <code>--apparent-size</code> option, and found that my R directory is using about 4.2 GB of actual disk space, factoring in the compression. <pre><code>[compute-048 /users/mmill116]$ time du -sh R\n4.2G    R\n\nreal    0m51.687s\nuser    0m0.486s\nsys 0m11.553s\n</code></pre> It also ran much quicker this time, due to caching done on the compute node. When data is accessed from a storage array, it is cached in the node's RAM for a while so that subsequent access to the same data will be done more efficiently.</p>"},{"location":"storage/storage-tips/#another-example-of-the-effect-of-compression","title":"Another example of the effect of compression","text":"<p>As mentioned above, we have compression enabled on the storage arrays on the JHPCE cluster.

While this is fine for a single-use system, in a shared environment where multiple users are accessing and utilizing /tmp simultaneously, there's a risk of resource contention and performance issues. If one user's processes generate large temporary files in /tmp, it can consume valuable disk space and potentially impact the performance of other users' processes. This can lead to slowdowns, crashes, or even denial of service for users relying on the shared resources. Overall, it's advisable to avoid using /tmp for and instead use your fastscratch space for temporary files</p> <p>If you must use /tmp you should first check to make sure that there is sufficient space for your temporary files. You could, for example, use the code below to make sure there is ate least 10GB (10000000 KB) in /tmp. <pre><code>FREETMP=`df -k /tmp | grep tmp | awk '{print $4}'`\nif [ $FREETMP -lt 10000000 ]\nthen\n   echo \"Not enough space in /tmp. Only $FREETMP KB available.\"\n   exit 1\nfi\n</code></pre> You should also make sure that your job deletes the files it created in /tmp.</p> <p>Different applications will have different options for specifying the location to use for temptoray files.  While we can't provide an exhausive list, here  is how some commonly used applicaiotn on JHPCE set their temporary location.   + In R, the <code>tmpdir()</code> setting will dictate where temporary files are stored.     If you are generating 10s of GB of temporary files, change <code>tmpdir()</code> to <code>fastscratch</code>.   + In SAS, the default <code>WORK</code> directory will be located under your     <code>fastscratch</code> directory.   + In Stata, the default <code>tempfile</code> location is under <code>/tmp</code>.

R works just fine for me on the cluster!</p> <p>A) On the JHPCE cluster we have historically had several ways to run R programs.  Often  people will use the text-based version of R to run programs, and that works well for a lot of people.  Some people prefer to work in a graphical environment, so we also have the X11-based \u201cRstudio\u201d available on the cluster, which is great, except that on a slower network connection, this can get quite laggy.  The web based Rstudio Server provides the same graphical version available in Rstudio, but over a much lighter network protocol than the X11-based Rstudio, so it is much faster and more responsive to use.</p> <p>Q) Why not just set up a dedicated web server to run Rstudio Server like I had back at ZZZZ?</p> <p>A) Rstudio Server does not play well with clusters.  For us to run a dedicated Rstudio Server server, we would need to purchase a fairly large system with lots of RAM and CPU power.  This was considered, but in the end was deemed cost prohibitive, and it didn\u2019t allow the use of the JHPCE cluster resources to run R programs.  This solution allows the nice web-based Rstudio Server to be used, while making use of the existing CPU and RAM resources available on the cluster.</p> <p>Q) My program can\u2019t run because it needs XXX package!</p> <p>A) The R that is run within the Rstudio Server is completely separate  from the default version of R that is used on the JHPCE cluster, therefor you may need to install packages using the install.packages() function, or through the Rstudio Server GUI .</p> <p>Q) I forgot to cleanly disconnect from the Rstudio Server/My session got disconnected.</p> <p>A) This should be fine.  Your interactive srun session will eventually time out and will kill the Rstudio Server that was running.  You may get warning messages about ports being in use \u2013 if so, please wait a few minutes and try again.</p> <p>Q) When I try to add the port forward, I get an error message about \u201cPort is in use\u201d.  How do I fix this?</p> <p>A) You can only run one instance of Rstudio Server. You likely have another SSH session running that has the port forward lingering.  If you had been using Rstudio Server in another SSH session, you will need to either need to log out of that ssh session, or run the \u201c~C\u201d \u201c-KL XXXXX\u201d command to tear down the port forward.</p> <p>If you have any questions  about using Rstudio Server, please feel free to email us at bitsupport.</p>","tags":["in-progress","refers-to-old-website"]},{"location":"sw/r-pkg/","title":"R Packages","text":""},{"location":"sw/r-pkg/#installing-r-packages","title":"Installing R packages","text":"<ul> <li>load R module from a compute node <pre><code>[test@compute-107 ~]$ module load R\nLoading R/4.3\n(4.3)[test@compute-107 ~]$\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>R points to conda_R.

The versions currently available, as of October 2023, are:</p> <p>jhpce-rstudio-server jhpce-rstudio-server-R4.3.0</p> <p>For CSUB users, use: csub-jhpce-rstudio-server-R4.3.0</p> <p>An example of running \u201cjhpce-rstudio-server\u201d is provided below.</p> <pre><code>\\[login31/users/jdoe1\\] $ **srun --pty --x11 --mem=10G bash**\nLast login: Wed May 1 17:02:29 2019 from login31.cm.cluster\nLoading conda\\_R/3.5.x\n\\[compute-012 /users/jdoe1\\] $ **jhpce-rstudio-server**\n------------\n1) Establish your SSH tunnel.\n\\* Windows users see: https://jhpce.jhu.edu/knowledge-base/rstudio-server\n\\* Mac or Linux Desktop users, please type:\n~C\n-L 12345:compute-012:12345\n\n2) From the browser running on your local system or SAFE desktop, go to:\n\n  http://localhost:12345\n\n3) When prompted for Username, enter your JHPCE ID:\u00a0 jdoe1\n4) When prompted for Password, enter your JHPCE password.\n\nWhen you are finished using Rstudio Server, type &lt;CTRL&gt;-C\n\n**~C**\nssh&gt; **\\-L 12345:compute-012:12345**\nForwarding port.\n</code></pre> <p>You will need to perform one step to enable access to this Rstudio Server from your local laptop/desktop;\u00a0 specifically, you will need to add a tunnel to your existing ssh session to the JHPCE cluster.</p> <p>For Mac or Linux laptops/desktops:</p> <p>To add this tunnel, first type ~C (while holding dhown SHIFT, press \u201c~\u201d then \u201cC\u201d).\u00a0 The\u00a0~C is used to send an interrupt to your ssh session.\u00a0 The\u00a0~C will likely not show up, but you should see an \u201cssh&gt;\u201d prompt as a result.\u00a0 At this \u201cssh&gt;\u201d prompt you\u00a0activate the tunnel by typing\u00a0 -L XXXXX:compute-YYY:XXXXX\u00a0 .\u00a0 This will allow your laptop/desktop to access the compute node comptue-YYY on port XXXXX (in the above example, the port used was 12345 and the compute node used was compute-012).</p> <p>For Windows based\u00a0laptops/desktops, or from the SAFE Desktop:</p> <p>If you connected to the JHPCE cluster with MobaXterm from a Windows-based system or SAFE desktop, you should ignore the first step (running ~C and adding the local tunnel).\u00a0 Instead, you will need to\u00a0\u00a0add a tunnel from MobaXterm.\u00a0 Before setting up the tunnel you may find it helpful to set up an SSH key using the steps at\u00a0https://jhpce.jhu.edu/knowledge-base/mobaxterm-configuration#ssh-keys While not a requirement, this will eliminate the need to login using your password and Google Verification Code.\u00a0 Note that if you are setting up the tunnel for the CSUB, you will not be able to use SSH keys due to the enhanced security of the CSUB.</p> <p>To start, click on the \u201cTunneling\u201d icon at the top of MobaXterm, and you should see the window below:</p> <p></p> <p>Click on \u201cNew SSH Tunnel\u201d, and you should see:</p> <p></p> <p>Enter the following in the window:</p> <ul> <li>For \u201cForwarded Port\u201d, enter the port number displayed (this is 12345 in the example)</li> <li>For \u201cRemote Server\u201d, enter the compute node (compute-012 in the example)</li> <li>For \u201cRemote Port\u201d, enter the port number (12345 in the example)</li> <li>For \u201cSSH Server\u201d, enter \u201cjhpce03.jhsph.edu\u201d if you are on the JHPCE cluster, or \u201cjhpcecms01.jhsph.edu\u201d if you are on the CSUB.</li> <li>For \u201cSSH Login\u201d, enter your JHPCE cluster login name (jdoe1 in the example)</li> <li>For \u201cSSH Port\u201d, enter \u201c22\u201d</li> </ul> <p>Then click \u201cSave\u201d, and you\u2019ll be take back to the \u201cMobaSSHTunnel\u201d screen with your new tunnel displayed.</p> <p></p> <p>Next, click on the yellow \u201cKey\u201d icon\u00a0  and browse to the location of your private key (the \u201c.ppk\u201d file).\u00a0 Now start your tunnel by clicking on the Green triangle icon in the \u201cStart/Stop\u201d column.</p> <p>Now that the tunnel is established, you can then access Rstudio Server from your laptop/desktop by using a web browser, and connecting to the url, http://localhost:XXXXX\u00a0.\u00a0 Once connected you will be prompted for your login and password, and you will need to enter you your JHPCE login and password at this point.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you enter your login and password, you should see Rstudio running in your browser.</p> <p></p> <p>If you are accessing the cluster from a Windows based system, you would need to take an extra step to set up the port forwarding.</p>"},{"location":"sw/rstudio-server/#shutting-down-the-rstudio-server","title":"Shutting down the Rstudio Server","text":"<p>When you have finished using Rstudio Server, you should close the browser tab or window that you are using to run Rstudio Server, and then return to the ssh session where you ran the \u201cjhpce-rstudio-server\u201d command.\u00a0 To stop the Rstudio Server, type \u201c^C\u201d.\u00a0 You will then be given a few additional steps to run to deactivate the port forward.

A) The R that is run within the Rstudio Server is completely separate\u00a0 from the default version of R that is used on the JHPCE cluster, therefor you may need to install packages using the\u00a0install.packages() function, or through the Rstudio Server GUI .</p> <p>Q) I forgot to cleanly disconnect from the Rstudio Server/My session got disconnected. A) This should be fine.\u00a0 Your interactive srun session will eventually time out and will kill the Rstudio Server that was running.\u00a0 You may get warning messages about ports being in use \u2013 if so, please wait a few minutes and try again.</p> <p>Q) When I try to add the port forward, I get an error message about \u201cPort is in use\u201d.\u00a0 How do I fix this? A) You can only run one instance of Rstudio Server.\u00a0You likely have another SSH session running that has the port forward lingering.\u00a0 If you had been using Rstudio Server in another SSH session, you will need to either need to log out of that ssh session, or run the \u201c~C\u201d \u201c-KL XXXXX\u201d command to tear down the port forward.</p> <p>If you have any questions\u00a0 about using Rstudio Server, please feel free to email us at bitsupport.</p>"},{"location":"sw/sas/","title":"SAS","text":""},{"location":"sw/sas/#we-have-a-sas-partition","title":"We Have A SAS Partition","text":"<p>We have a limited number of licenses.

Since you\u2019re using vscode to make that connection, it\u2019s not a \u201creal\u201d ssh session, so it won\u2019t be able to interpret the Ctrl+C.
